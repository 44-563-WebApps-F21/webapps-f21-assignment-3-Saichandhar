    <h3>Circle-Line Intersection</h3>

    <blockquote>To determine the position of a line with respect to a circle, we’ll find its 
      distance from the center of the circle. Let d be this distance and r be the radius of the circle.
       Then,

        if d < r , then the line cuts the circle at two distinct points.
        if d = r, then the line touches the circle at one point.
        if d > r, then the line does not intersect/touch the circle.
